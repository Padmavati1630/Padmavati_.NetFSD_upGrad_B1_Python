# Multi-Page E-Learning Platform

## Project Description

This is a **frontend-only multi-page e-learning web application** built using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript**.

The platform allows users to explore courses, attempt quizzes, track their learning progress, and view performance — all without a backend server.

The application uses **LocalStorage** to persist user data and simulates **asynchronous data loading** to provide a dynamic user experience.
